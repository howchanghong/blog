# Study Skills
How to Study more Effectively and Efficiently

## PURPOSE
While Singapore’s education is very holistic in terms of the subjects that is taught, the education system fails to teach students how to be a better learner and study better. This guide is not a holy grail, but an individual’s experience and culmination of knowledge and strategies developed through my years of study. 

## Overview
1. Learning Science
2. Time Management
3. Notes Making
4. Classroom lessons
5. Exam Mugging Sessions
6. Exam Strategies

## 1) Learning Science
### 1. Individual Learning Styles
#### i. Kinesthetic Learner
#### ii. Visual Learner
#### iii. Auditory Learner

### 2. Memory
#### i. Reinforcement Learning
a) First read - Pre-lesson skim  
b) Second read - During lesson  
c) Third read - Writing Informative notes on Topic  
d) Fourth read - Doing assignments using Informative notes  
e) Fifth read - Making Cram Notes  
#### ii. Make internal links between the concepts in the topic.  
a) Form a memory web.
#### iii. Make external links to information you already know.  
a) Memory Castle  
b) Life examples  
c) Other knowledge learnt  

### 3. Time Management
#### i. Develop a weekly schedule of all activities. (Physical/ Digital)

a) Start with filling up mandatory school activities - school 7lectures, tutorials, CCAs.

b) Schedule in study time by subjects.

* Recommended at least two hours per day of study time.  
* Plan at least one hour blocks of study time and switch between subjects.  
* Make use of weekday morning, school breaks and nights for doing homework.  
* Use weekends for revision. Study at least two or three different subjects per day.  

c) Schedule in time to take breaks/ outings with friends!  

d) Keep multiple copies of schedule everywhere, especially in your phone - no excuses since you are 24/7 on your phone.  

#### ii. Create a To Do list for all homework/ assignments. 
a) The satisfaction derived to cross them off is indescribable.

### 4. Notes Making
#### i. Do not rely just on printed notes.  
Creating your own set of personal meaningful notes help tremendously in understanding the topic. It also gives you motivation in taking responsible of your own learning.  
#### ii. Create two sets of notes:
a) Informative Notes to contain all the information related to the subject.  

b) Cram Notes - preferably a single page note for each topic to contain mnemonics/ key ideas to trigger the pointers.

* Leave out examples.

c) Different types of notes taking:

* Charting  
* Mind Maps  
* Cornell  
* Outline  
* Flashcards  

### 5. Classroom Lessons
#### i. Pre-read.
Highly recommended to at least skim through the topics to be taught before the lessons to get a mental glimpse of what is to be expected.  
#### ii. Attend the classes. 
The teachers are telling/hinting you what is the important materials that will most likely appear on assessments. If the teacher repeats a point, assume it is very important - write it down.  
#### iii. Notes Taking. 
a) Do not copy and record word for word. Use the outline method to quickly take down important points.  

b) If notes are not provided, you should probably record everything that is on the screen/blackboard, especially definitions. (Caution - try to internalise the materials as you are copying)  

* You will probably need to re-write these notes into proper Informative notes.

#### iv. Ask questions!  
a) Ask to repeat the concepts in a different perspective.  

b) Ask about edge cases.  

c) Ask for examples of real-life applications.  

### 6. Exam Mugging Sessions
#### i. Mug Early
Intense mugging sessions should start 1 - 2 months before your first paper.

#### ii. Make Cram notes
Create Cram notes from informative notes if you have not. 

#### iii.Create a different study schedule.
a) By now, you should eliminate all other non-essential activities. E.g. CCAs, outings.

b) Divide up the day into segments for each subject:

* If lessons are still on-going, divide into afternoon and night.
* Else, morning, afternoon, night
* Work on a different subject for each segment.

c) Take a break every 50 minutes to use the restroom, drink water, use the phone and walk around.

d) Find a conducive place to study.

* The bed is not a conducive place. 
* Eliminate distractions. Off all your electronics (phone included).
* Have all materials in arms reach. E.g. Notes, assessment books, stationary, calculator. 

e) Study individually first to understand the topics.

* You can study in groups when working on additional assessments. 

### 7. Exam Strategy
#### i. The night before: Sleep well. 
It is more important to sleep than to try to memorise a few more times. 

#### ii. The morning: Don’t stress or panic. 
a) Do not try to cram any more things.

b) Read through the cram notes. 

c) Recall the cram notes. 

d) Eat a good hearty breakfast (chicken essence if you wish).

#### iii.The Exam
a) Skim through the paper

b) Write down any complex equations / pointers you are afraid that you will forget immediately on the exam paper. 

c) If you are uncertain of a question, skip it first. 

d) Ensure you read all the information provided in the questions. Highlight if you wish to. 

e) For multiple choice, go by the process of elimination. 

f) For essays, always outline your answers before starting on it. 

g) If you have to choose between perfecting an answer and attempting an unanswered question, choose to do the unanswered question.

* It is a lot easier to get marks for low level answers.
